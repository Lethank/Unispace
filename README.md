This repository is the result of a project in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Democritus University of Thrace, in Xanthi, Greece. This project was developed in 2019 throughout the "Software Engineering" course and it is the work of students during the semester.<br>
It is a web-based university management software, for use by students, faculty and administrators.<br>
It supports enrollment, grade books, a messaging service and overall curriculum management. It supports all modern browsers and we have also created an Android app.

## Technologies-Prerequisites
This project was written in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and SQL.<br>
In order to execute, it requires a web server or local testing software like xampp or wamp.

## Getting Started
1. Upload the source files in the server's directory
2. Import Database/Testing.sql at your MariaDB/MySQL server
3. Manually insert a user at the users table in the database in order to be able to login
4. Change the host/username/password from the php files that connect to the database (login.php, logout.php, auth.php)
